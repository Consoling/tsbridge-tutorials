The two Big categories

Absolute Unit = fixed size

px (pixels): like dots on your screen
pt (points): 1 point = 1/72 inch
cm, mm, in: real world measurements


Relative Unit = flexible size

em: based on current font size
rem: based on root font size
%: based on parent element
vw, vh: based on screen size

view width and view height and view port


The font size Foundation:

font-size: 16px;

1rem = 16px

1em = 16px


Unit I - Pixels:

1px = 1dot on the screen

pixels are absolute 

for example 10px  = 10px


<!-- when to use pixels -->

Borders (1px, 2px)
small details that would never change
image dimension

<img width="100px" height='100px'/>


Unit II - EM: 
current element font size = 16px
1em = current elements font size


if font size = 16px then 1em = 16px
if font size = 20px thne 1em = 20px
 

 2em = 2 * font-size
 2em = 2* 16px = 32px

 3em = 3 * font-size
 3em = 3* 16px = 48px

 0.5em = 1/2 of 16px
 0.5em = 1/2 * 16px = 8px

 

 
Unit II - REM: 

1rem = root elements font size (16px)

key difference from em:

em = based on current element
rem = based on root (html element)
rem never stacks



Unit III - Percentage: 

Percentage is always relative to its parent element

- width/height is of parents width/height

- font-size - percentage of parent's font-size
- margin/padding - percentage of parent's width
