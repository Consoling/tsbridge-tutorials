What is a Responsive Design?

A responsive design is a web dev approach that ensures websites adapt and display optimally across different devices and screen sizes.

Screen Sizes:
- SM, MD, LG, XL, 2XL

SM - mobile devices
MD - Tablets
LG- Laptops
XL - Monitors, Tv screen
2XL - Larger TV's


Logical Approach:

Instead of creating separate mobile and desktop versions,

We can create responsive designs using flexible layouts, images, and css media queries to create a single websites
that works on every screen size


CSS Media Queries:

Media Queries are CSS3 Features that allows us to apply different styles based on different screen width, height 
, orientation, resolution, and more. 


Basic Syntax:

@media media-type and (media-feature){
    CSS rules go here
}

Components:

@media = The at rule that starts a media query
media-type = Specifies the type of media (screen, print, speech, etc)
and - combine conditions
media-feature: The condition being tested (width, height)

Media TYpes:

1. Screens: Mobiles. laptops, Tablets, Monitors, etc...
2. Print: For printed pages and print preview
3. speech: Speech synthesizers
4. all: Match all devices 

Media features:
 1. Width-based features:
width - exact viewport width
min-width
max-width
device-width

 2. Height-based feature:
 height: exact viewport height
 min-height
 max-height

 3. orientation
 landscape
 portrait

 4. resolution

 resolution: screen pixel density(96dpi, 300dpi, 2dppx)
 min-resolution
 max-resolution

 Standard Breakpoints:

 Extra Small Devices (phones): <576px (0px - 576px)
 Small Devices (landscape phones): >= 576px (576px - 767px)
 Medium Device (tablets): >= 768px (768px - 991px)
 Large Device (Laptops): >=992px  (992px - 1199px)
 Extra Large Devices: >= 1200px  (1200px - 1439px)

 Best Approach:

 Mobile-first Website:
 start with mobile styles as base
 use min width

 Desktop first approach:
 start with desktop styles as base
 use max-width
